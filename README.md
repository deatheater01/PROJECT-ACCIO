Problem Statements:	
The aftermath of each and every natural disaster is always followed by huge rescue teams and organizations swooping in to save the survivors. And they are mostly successful except in cases where they can’t find people close to them or when survivors are scattered that they never had a way to group together making it difficult for them to survive on their own. This scattered population also makes it hard to send Aid packages to where it’s needed. Aid packages are also wasted if dropped at wrong locations which can further damage the situation or become useless.

Solution:

We plan on creating a mobile app which will help create a Mesh network using smartphones even with the absence of mobile towers using the mobile’s inbuilt hardware.
The network can help users connect to other users nearby instantly and help them locate each other thus bringing the survivors together.
The app also has a built in survival guide from the WHO
The survivors can call and chat via the network which will help them come together
App will be as light as possible to reduce battery consumption while still providing necessary functionality
The rescue teams will be equipped with cost-efficient, minimal functionality, long range antennas designed to detect these mesh networks and help pinpoint the survivor’s location(in the disaster area) and visualise using the network nodes and radio waves from the network.
This device can be modified to fit into a variety of machines and vehicles including Drones which will help locate survivors in unreachable locations.
We also plan to integrate SDR functionality into the devices for places where smartphones aren’t prevalent.
Once we have the locations of survivors and receive the topographical data of the region, we combine this with aerial photographs to map locations where Aid packages are needed the most. We then use all available data to calculate locations where aid packages need to be dropped off(altitude and speed) to maximize the effectiveness of the packages to the survivors while making sure the package lands unharmed. We calculate the drop points using a multitude of factors including Wind speed and the unique topography of the region.
